\subsection{Structure of this work}
This is done by giving a short summary of the history and
evolution of programming languages and their adaption to
fundamental changes of the underlying hardware, especially the
advent of distributed systems in chapter \ref{distributedprogramming}.

Chapter \ref{relatedwork} then succesively introduces the related
projects and tries to extract and hightlight their relevant aspects
to the \textit{Drift} project.

Chapter \ref{drift} then introduces the components of the
\textit{Drift Programming Environment} by first introducing the
Drift language in chapter \ref{driftlang} including its implementation
in form the of the Drift shell. This is followed by the introduction
of the Drift system implementation in chapter
\ref{driftimplementation} including an extensive explanation of
the error model and distributed error handling procedure.
Finally, chapter \ref{driftui} presents the Drift UI prototype
which features the Drift shell as introduced in chapter \ref{driftshell}
as well as an interactive graphical representation of the
current state of the entire system using the Petri Net syntax
and an event time line that allows to effortlessly review previews
system states.

Chapter \ref{summary} then summarizes the presented work, including
all the presented components and their contribution to the overall
system and chapter \ref{futurework} thoroughly discusses possible
improvements regarding the implementation of each individual component
as it was introduced in chapter \ref{drift} as well as possible
progressions of future projects.
