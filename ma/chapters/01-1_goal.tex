\subsection{Goal of this work}
To face these challenges and to analyze and explore the
concepts needed by software engineers to describe, construct and program
these system, the following work presents the
\textit{Drift Programming Environment}, a collection of different
components that allow the programming and orchestration of a
distributed system of autonomous services by describing
their data dependencies.

The goal of this work is to not only present each individual
component of the final result, which includes an abstract,
imperative and stateful coordination language, an immutable
file system based on distributed message queues and an interactive
user interface based on the syntax of Petri Nets,
but also to introduce the reader to the set of projects and the
people that created these projects, and their ideas and philosophies,
that served as inspirations and guidance for the ideas and design decisions
included in the \textit{Drift} project.
